# Translator from CORAL to Python

### With the previous app you will be able to translate code from CORAL language (documentation included at the end of the file) to Python 3 language.

### This app has been made with Java using framework ANTLR for designing languages incluiding lexer and parsers from themselves

### To run this programm you must have installed ANTLR in your dev environment and Java compiler (I recommend you to use Intellij IDE)



### CORAL docs: https://corallanguage.org/spec/
